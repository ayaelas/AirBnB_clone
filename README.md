0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

This is the first step to build our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

The AirBnB clone project is a small version of the AirBnB website , it contains :
    - How to serialize and deserialize a Class
    - How to manage Data Storage
    - How to write and read a JSON file
    - How to handle named arguments in a function
    - What do " *args " and " **kwargs " mean and how to use them 
    
A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
